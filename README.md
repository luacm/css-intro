# Introduction to CSS
So, you've mastered defining the structure of your website using [HTML](https://github.com/luacm/html) and you're a bit... underwhelmed. Sure, it has structure, but it has no *style*. That's where CSS comes in.

Remember our Web Trifecta:
1. HTML: The semantics of the site.
2. CSS: The presentation of the site.
3. JavaScript: The behavior of the site.

So now we're on the second part! The presentation.

## What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. That might not make much sense now, but it will shortly. 

Basically, CSS is just a list of rules - rules that define how certain elements on your page look. Here's an example:

```CSS
h1 {
  color: purple;
  font-size: 36px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

Here, we said that all ```<h1>``` tags should have purple text, a font size of 36px, and be center aligned. Cool, huh?
